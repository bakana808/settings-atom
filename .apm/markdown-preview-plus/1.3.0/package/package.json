Show the rendered HTML markdown to the right of the\ncurrent editor using the keymap `ctrl-shift-m`.\n\n## New Features\n\n- **LaTeX equation rendering**  \n  LaTeX equations in the source markdown are rendered in the preview pane.\n  Rendering of LaTeX equations in the preview pane can be toggled with\n  `ctrl-shift-x`. Please see [LaTeX](LATEX.md) for more details.\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\n1.  Search for **Markdown Preview Plus** in the menu **File &rsaquo; Settings\n    &rsaquo; Packages** and click **Install**. Please allow 3-5 mins for\n    installation. Alternatively if you would prefer to use the command line\n    utility `apm`:\n\n    ````bash\n    $ apm install markdown-preview-plus\n    ````\n\n2.  Disable the built in Markdown Preview package. You can do this by searching\n    for **Markdown Preview Plus** in the **Filter packages** input dialogue of\n    the **File &rsaquo; Settings** menu and clicking **Disable**.\n\n3.  Markdown Preview Plus requires the\n    [mathjax-wrapper](https://github.com/Galadirith/mathjax-wrapper) package to\n    be installed to preview LaTeX. To install mathjax-wrapper search for\n    **mathjax-wrapper** in the menu **File &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; Packages**\n    and click **Install**. Please allow 10-15 mins for installation of\n    mathjax-wrapper. Alternatively if you would prefer to use the command line\n    utility `apm`:\n\n    ````bash\n    $ apm install mathjax-wrapper\n    ````\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThese a common problems that you may experience when installing or updating MPP\nwith suggested solutions. If the suggested solution doesn't fix your problem or\nyou have experienced a problem not listed here please open up an\n[issue](https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-preview-plus/issues/new).\n\n- **I've installed MPP but I cannot open a preview tab**  \n  After installation a complete restart (close all open Atom windows and reopen)\n  of Atom may be required to enable the packages functionality.\n\n- **I've installed MPP but I cannot toggle LaTeX in the preview**  \n  Since version `1.0.0`\n  [mathjax-wrapper](https://github.com/Galadirith/mathjax-wrapper) is required\n  by MPP to preview LaTeX, and has to be installed separately.  The majority\n  of the time spent installing MPP in versions prior to `1.0.0` was installing\n  the MathJax dependency. mathjax-wrapper now handles installing MathJax which\n  means installing MPP should be significantly faster, and allow for more\n  frequent updates.\n\n- **After updating installation MPP no longer renders LaTeX**  \n  You have two options that should resolve this issue.\n\n  The first is to perform a full reinstallation of MPP. You can do this by\n  searching for **Markdown Preview Plus** in the **Filter packages** input\n  dialogue of the **File &rsaquo; Settings** menu and clicking **Uninstall**.\n  Then follow the **Installation Instructions** to reinstall MPP.\n\n  If a full reinstallation doesn't work please follow these instructions:\n\n  1.  Open up `~/.atom/packages/markdown-preview-plus/node_modules` in a file\n      explorer and Delete the folder named **roaster**.\n\n  2.  Open up a terminal (on windows you should use **powershell**) and run the\n      following commands:\n\n      ````bash\n      $ cd ~/.atom/packages/markdown-preview-plus\n      $ apm update\n      ````\n  3.  You should see a progress message `Installing Modules`, and will be\n      complete when it displays `Installing Modules done` which may take\n      1-5mins.\n\n## License\n\nMarkdown Preview Plus (MPP) is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-preview-plus/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-preview-plus","_id":"markdown-preview-plus@1.3.0","_shasum":"52348ee636895d74661000059e79826d19c03e09","_resolved":"file:..\\d-115329-8344-1f8qiqv\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-115329-8344-1f8qiqv\\package.tgz"}
